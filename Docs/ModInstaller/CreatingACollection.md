title: Creating a Mod Collection
---

## Requirements
* Simple Mod Installer V2.0.0.0 or higher - [Download Here][1]
* A Windows 7 or higher PC

## Prerequisites

Install Minecraft Forge for the Minecraft Version you want your Collection to be. as detailed Below:

1. go to the [Forge website][2]
2. Click on the Minecraft Version you want to mod.
3. Click either "Installer Win" or "Installer".
4. Click "Skip Ad" at the top right corner of the screen.
5. Save the File somewhere memorable.
6. Open minecraft and select the version of minecraft you want to mod.
7. Once Minecraft has loaded - close it.
8. Run the Forge Installer.
9. Run minecraft using the newly created profile called "Forge"

HANDY TIP: Rename the profile to Forge [Minecraft Version]. For Example: 

    If I'd just installed Forge for 1.7.10 I'd call the profile: "Forge 1.7.10" This makes it much easier later.

## Part 1: Creating your first Collection

1. Download the Mod / mods you wish to install, making sure they are compatible with the Forge Version you just installed.
2. Start the Simple Mod Installer - Making sure you are connected to the internet if this is your first start
3. Click on the Grass Block icon labelled "Install a mod or manage a collection"
4. Click "Create One" at the bottom of the window that pops up
5. Fill in the boxes - Make sure the Minecraft Version you enter is the same as the one your mod is. See Picture to the right:
6. Click Continue
7. A Message should tell you that your collection has been created. Click OK.
8. You should now see a window like this: <img style="vertical-align:top" alt="Collection View Image" src="/resources/help_files/ModInstaller/CollectionView.JPG" height="300px">

9. Click "Add Mods"
10. In the Window select what you'd like to do.
11. Select either the mod file to import or the folder full of mods you'd like to import - NOTE: To prevent glitches if you're importing a folder then the only folder in that folder can be named the Minecraft Version your collection is. E.G. mine can only contain a folder called 1.7.10 because that's the version I specified for my collection to be.
12. Click Add Mod(s)
13. You have now made a mod collection!

## Part 2: Playing your Collection

1. Click "Activate Collection" at the bottom of the screen
2. It should come up with a box that essentially says: "Collection Active!"
3. Click OK
4. Open the Minecraft Launcher
5. Select the Forge Profile for the correct version of Minecraft for your collection.
6. Click Play

SUCCESS! - You have now created and activated your first collection.
